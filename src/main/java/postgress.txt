 we will show you step by step how to reset the password of the postgres user in PostgreSQL.

For some reason, after installing PostgreSQL, you may forget the password of the postgres user. In this case, you need to know how to reset the password.

PostgreSQL uses the pg_hba.conf configuration file stored in the database data directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data on Windows) to control the client authentication. The hba in pg_hba.conf means host-based authentication.

To reset the password for the postgres user, you need to modify some parameters in this configuration file, login as postgres without a password, and reset the password.

The following steps show you how to reset a password for the postgres user:

Step 1. Backup the pg_hba.conf file by copying it to a different location or just rename it to pg_hba.conf.bk

Step 2. Edit the pg_dba.conf file and change all local connections from md5 to trust. By doing this, you can log in to the PostgreSQL database server without using a password.

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust

Step 3. Restart the PostgreSQL server. If you are on Windows, you can restart the PostgreSQL from Services:


Or run the following command from the window terminal:

pg_ctl -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data" restart
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
The "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data" is the data directory.

Step 4. Connect to PostgreSQL database server using any tool such as psql or pgAdmin:

psql -U postgres
PostgreSQL will not require a password to login.

Step 5. Execute the following command to set a new password for the postgres user.

postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
Step 6. Restore the pg_dba.conf file, restart the PostgreSQL database server and connect to the PostgreSQL database server with the new password.

In this tutorial, you have learned how to reset the password of the postgres user.
Edit the pg_hba.conf file

sudo vi /Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/data/pg_hba.conf

Change the "md5" method for all users to "trust" near the bottom of the file

Find the name of the service

ls /Library/LaunchDaemons

Look for postgresql

Stop the postgresql service

sudo launchctl stop com.edb.launchd.postgresql-9.2

Start the postgresql service

sudo launchctl start com.edb.launchd.postgresql-9.2

Start psql session as postgres

psql -U postgres

(shouldn't ask for password because of 'trust' setting)

Reset password in psql session by typing

ALTER USER postgres with password 'secure-new-password';

\q
enter

Edit the pg_hba.conf file

Switch it back to 'md5'

Restart services again
